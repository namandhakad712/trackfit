# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TrackFit application currently provides the same dashboard and feature access to all users regardless of their role (admin, depot_manager, inspector). This creates security concerns and usability issues as users see features they shouldn't access and lack role-specific workflows. This feature will implement role-based access control (RBAC) with dynamic dashboards that adapt to each user's role, providing appropriate features and navigation based on their permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Inspector Role Dashboard and Access

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to see only inspection-related features on my dashboard, so that I can focus on my core responsibility of conducting inspections without being distracted by administrative features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an inspector logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing only inspection statistics (total inspections, pass/fail rates, recent inspections)
2. WHEN an inspector accesses the navigation menu THEN the system SHALL show only "Scan QR", "My Inspections", and "Profile" menu items
3. WHEN an inspector attempts to access the fittings management page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page with a 403 status
4. WHEN an inspector attempts to access the vendors page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page with a 403 status
5. WHEN an inspector attempts to access the admin settings page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page with a 403 status
6. WHEN an inspector scans a QR code THEN the system SHALL allow them to create a new inspection for that fitting
7. WHEN an inspector views their inspections list THEN the system SHALL display only inspections they have personally created
8. IF an inspector tries to access a protected route via direct URL THEN the system SHALL validate their role and deny access if unauthorized

### Requirement 2: Depot Manager Role Dashboard and Access

**User Story:** As a depot manager, I want to manage fittings inventory and view inspection reports for my depot, so that I can maintain proper inventory control and quality oversight without needing full administrative privileges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a depot manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing fitting statistics (total fittings, status breakdown, warranty alerts) and inspection overview for their depot
2. WHEN a depot manager accesses the navigation menu THEN the system SHALL show "Dashboard", "Fittings", "Inspections", "Alerts", "Scan QR", and "Profile" menu items
3. WHEN a depot manager accesses the fittings page THEN the system SHALL allow them to view, add, edit, and delete fittings
4. WHEN a depot manager accesses the inspections page THEN the system SHALL display all inspections for fittings in their depot location
5. WHEN a depot manager accesses the alerts page THEN the system SHALL display alerts related to fittings in their depot location
6. WHEN a depot manager attempts to access the admin settings page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page with a 403 status
7. WHEN a depot manager attempts to access the vendors page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page with a 403 status
8. WHEN a depot manager attempts to access user management features THEN the system SHALL deny access
9. IF a depot manager has a depot_location assigned THEN the system SHALL filter all data (fittings, inspections, alerts) to show only records for their depot

### Requirement 3: Admin Role Dashboard and Access

**User Story:** As an admin, I want full access to all system features including user management, vendor analytics, and system settings, so that I can oversee the entire operation and configure the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive dashboard showing system-wide statistics (all fittings, all inspections, vendor performance, alerts, user activity)
2. WHEN an admin accesses the navigation menu THEN the system SHALL show all menu items including "Dashboard", "Fittings", "Inspections", "Vendors", "Alerts", "Users", "Settings", "Scan QR", and "Profile"
3. WHEN an admin accesses the fittings page THEN the system SHALL display all fittings across all depot locations with full CRUD capabilities
4. WHEN an admin accesses the inspections page THEN the system SHALL display all inspections system-wide
5. WHEN an admin accesses the vendors page THEN the system SHALL display vendor analytics and quality metrics
6. WHEN an admin accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of system parameters, integrations, and preferences
7. WHEN an admin accesses the users page THEN the system SHALL display all users with ability to create, edit, deactivate users and modify roles
8. WHEN an admin accesses the alerts page THEN the system SHALL display all alerts system-wide
9. WHEN an admin views any data THEN the system SHALL NOT apply depot-based filtering unless explicitly requested

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Route Protection

6. IF a user's session contains an outdated role THEN the system SHALL refresh the role from the database
7. WHEN role validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the unauthorized access attempt with user ID, role, and attempted route
8. WHEN a user is redirected to unauthorized page THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating insufficient permissions

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Navigation Component

5. WHEN an admin's navigation renders THEN the system SHALL display all available navigation links including "Users", "Vendors", and "Settings"
6. WHEN a navigation item is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding route
